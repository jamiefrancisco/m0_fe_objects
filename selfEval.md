# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
*I feel most confident in the arrays and objects exercises. The more logically complex problems that involve or combine conditionals or trickier (for me) syntax like the for statements are what I'd like more practice with*

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
*Feeling good. I am using my calendar in preparation for Mod 1 and taking plenty of breaks before (and when) I get stuck.*

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
 *Examples of data that benefits from using an object vs. an array.*
